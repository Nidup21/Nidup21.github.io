## Lesson 12

### Good Relational Database Design Features
   -  Separate Relations for Entities:
      - Each entity should have its own relation.   For example, in a university database, there are separate relations for classroom, department, course, etc. This ensures that attributes of different entities are not mixed, and only foreign keys are used to reference other entities.

   - Minimizing Null Values: 
     - Design relations to have as few NULL values as possible. If an attribute is frequently NULL, it can be moved to a separate relation with the primary key.

   - Avoiding Spurious Tuples: 
     - Bad designs can lead to incorrect results in JOIN operations. Relations should be designed to satisfy the lossless join condition. A lossless decomposition means that when a relation is split into two, no information is lost, i.e., 
ΠR1(r)⋈ΠR2(r)=r
.
   - Eliminating Redundancy: 
      - Redundancy causes issues like extra storage space, inconsistent data during updates, and complex deletion and insertion operations.

   - Preventing Modification Anomalies: 
      - There are three types of anomalies - update, deletion, and insertion. For example, an update anomaly occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places and updating one instance leads to inconsistency.
### Normalization Theory and Normal Forms

   - Normalization Basics: 
     - Normalization is a technique to reduce data redundancy and improve data retrieval. It involves decomposing relational schemas into appropriate normal forms in a lossless way.

   - Functional Dependencies: 
     - These are relationships between attributes in a relation. For example, in X→Y, X is the determinant and Y is the dependent. Armstrong's axioms (reflexivity, augmentation, transitivity) help in reasoning about dependencies.

   - Normal Forms: 
     - There are several normal forms like 1NF, 2NF, Boyce - Codd Normal Form (BCNF), 3NF, 4NF, and 5NF. BCNF requires that for all non - trivial functional dependencies α→β, α is a superkey. 3NF is a bit more relaxed and allows for some dependencies that BCNF might not.
### Decomposition Algorithms
   - BCNF Decomposition: 
      - It is used to test if a relation is in BCNF. The algorithm iteratively decomposes non - BCNF relations. While it can resolve many issues, it may sacrifice dependency preservation.

   - 3NF Decomposition: 
      - This algorithm uses a canonical cover of functional dependencies. It creates a new relation schema for each functional dependency in the canonical cover, ensures lossless decomposition, and preserves dependencies.

## Lesson 13
### Database Systems Fundamentals

  - Multivalued Dependencies and 4NF
Limitations of BCNF:
     -  BCNF is great at removing some redundancies, but it doesn't always eliminate all. For example, in a university database, an instructor with multiple addresses and departments may still have redundant data even in BCNF.
  - Multivalued Dependencies: 
     - A multivalued dependency 
X↠Y holds when the X values are independent of combining the Y values with other values. For instance, in the inst schema, if an instructor can have multiple addresses, ID↠street,city might hold.

  - Fourth Normal Form (4NF): 
    - A schema is in 4NF if whenever a non - trivial multivalued dependency X↠Y holds, X
is a superkey. Decomposing a schema into 4NF can help remove remaining redundancies.

### More Normal Forms
 
  - Join Dependencies and PJNF:
    -  Join dependencies generalize multivalued dependencies and led to the definition of Project - Join Normal Form (PJNF), also known as 5NF. PJNF aims to eliminate remaining redundancies not captured by 4NF.

  - Domain - Key Normal Form (DKNF): 
     - It is based on a more general class of constraints than join dependencies. However, both PJNF and DKNF are rarely used in practice due to the complexity of their constraints and the lack of complete inference rules.

### Atomic Domains and 1NF
   - Atomicity Requirement:
    - In the relational model, attribute values should be atomic. First Normal Form (1NF) is satisfied when all attributes in a relation have atomic domains.

- Non - Atomic Values: 
    - Examples of non - atomic values include composite attributes (like an address with multiple components), multi - valued attributes (like a set of phone numbers), and attributes with sub - parts. These can cause issues like data redundancy and update inconsistencies.

### Database Design Process

  - Schema Sources: 
    - Initial schemas can be obtained from an Entity - Relationship (E - R) diagram, as a single all - encompassing schema, or through an ad - hoc design. A well - designed E - R diagram can lead to schemas that need little normalization.

  - Design Principles: 
    - Following principles like the unique role assumption and having good naming conventions can improve database understandability. Sometimes, databases are denormalized for performance, but this requires extra application logic to maintain consistency.

### Modeling Temporal Data
  -  Temporal Data Basics: 
     - Temporal data is valid only over a specific time period. For example, an instructor's address may be associated with start and end dates.

  - Database Modeling: 
     - To model temporal data, we add start and end time columns to relevant relations. However, time introduces complexity as standard functional dependencies may not hold across all time, and primary keys need to ensure no overlapping valid periods. The SQL:2011 standard added some support for temporal data, but full temporal query support is still lacking in most databases.

## Conclusion
After studying Lessons 12 and 13, I've learned so much about database design. In Lesson 12, I saw how important it is to plan databases carefully and how normalization and decomposition algorithms can make databases better. It was hard at first, but I'm excited to use what I learned in real projects.
Lesson 13 took my knowledge further. Multivalued dependencies and new normal forms were interesting, but I understand why some are not used often because they're complex. Learning about atomic domains and 1NF reminded me of the basics. The database design process and E - R diagrams seem really useful. And modeling temporal data is tough but important.
