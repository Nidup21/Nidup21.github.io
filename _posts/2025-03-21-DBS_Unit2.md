##  Entity-Relationship Model ( ER )
    The Entity-Relationship (E-R) model is used for designing databases by representing the structure of the database logically. It helps in building the foundation of logical data models.

### Components of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

- Entity:

   - Represents a “thing” or “object” in the real world.

   - Distinguishable from all other objects.

      - Example: Customer, Product, Employee.

- Attributes:

   - Descriptive properties or characteristics of an entity.

       - Example: Customer Name, Product Price, Employee ID.

- Relationship:

    - Describes associations between two or more entities.

       - Example: Customer places Order, Employee works on Project.

- Key Benefits of E-R Model:

    - Simplifies database design.

    - Provides a clear and organized view of data structure.

## Entity Relationship Model

### Components of an ERD:

- 1.Entity:

   An entity is like a "thing" or "object" that exists in the real world.

   It’s something that you can clearly identify, like a person, place, or thing.

   Examples: A Student, a Book, or a Car can all be entities.


- 2.Attributes:

  Attributes are the details or characteristics that describe an entity.

  They give us more information about the entity.

   - For example, if the entity is a Student, the attributes could be: 
          name, age, student_id and major
  

- 3.Relationship:

  A relationship is a connection or association between two or more entities.

  It shows how different entities work together or relate to each other.

  Relationships are usually described using verbs like assign, track, belongs to, or works with.

  For example:

  - A Student enrolls in a Course.

  - An Employee works for a Department.


## Primary Key
    The Primary Key is used to uniquely identify each entity in an entity set (table).

It ensures that no two entities have the same values for all their attributes.

The primary key is chosen from a set of candidate keys by the database designer.

- It must:

  Uniquely identify each record in a table (row).

  Not be null (cannot be empty or missing).

  In an ER model, the primary key is shown by underlining the attribute(s) that make up the key.

  Example:
  For a Student entity, the Student ID could be the primary key because it uniquely identifies each student.

## ERD: Complex Attributes
1. Simple Attributes: Attributes are not divided into
subparts.
2. Composite Attributes: Attributes can be
divided into subparts.
3. Single-valued Attributes: Attributes have
single value for a particular entity.
4. Multi-valued Attributes: Attributes have more
than one value for a particular entity
5. Derived Attributes: The value for the attribute
can be derived from the values of other related
attributes or entities.

## ERD: Types of Attributes
1. Simple Attribute
An attribute that cannot be further subdivided into components is a simple attribute. 

3. Single-Valued Attribute
The attribute which takes up only a single value for each entity instance is a single-valued attribute. 

2. Composite Attribute
An attribute that can be split into components is a composite attribute. 

4. Multi-Valued Attribute  
The attribute which takes up more than a single value for each entity instance is a multi-valued attribute. And it is represented by double oval shape.

5. Stored Attribute
 The stored attribute are those attribute which doesn’t require any type of further update since they are stored in the database.

 6. Derived Attribute  
An attribute that can be derived from other attributes is derived attributes. And it is represented by dotted oval shape.

7. Complex Attribute 
Those attributes, which can be formed by the nesting of composite and multi-valued attributes, are called “Complex Attributes“. 

8. Key attribute
Key attributes are those attributes that can uniquely identify the entity in the entity set.

9. Null Attribute
This attribute can take NULL value when entity does not have value for it.

10. Descriptive Attribute
Descriptive attribute give information about the relationship set example given below. Here Start Date is the descriptive attribute of Manages relationship.

In an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, attributes are features that describe entities or relationships. They can be simple, composite, derived, multi-valued, or key attributes. Simple attributes are basic, while composite ones are made up of smaller parts. Derived attributes are calculated from other attributes, multi-valued ones can hold multiple values, and key attributes uniquely identify each entity. These attributes help organize and understand data in a database model.

### Mapping Cardinalities (Cardinality Ratios):
    Mapping cardinalities define the number of entities in one set that can be associated with entities in another set through a relationship.

1. One-to-One:

   An entity in A is linked to only one entity in B, and vice versa.

   Example: A person has one passport, and each passport is linked to one person.

2. One-to-Many:

   An entity in A can be linked to many entities in B, but each entity in B is linked to only one entity in A.

   Example: A department has many employees, but each employee works in only one department.

3. Many-to-One:

   An entity in A can be linked to only one entity in B,  but an entity in B can be linked to many entities in A.

   Example: Many surgeries are performed by one surgeon, but each surgery has one surgeon.

4. Many-to-Many:

   Entities in A can be linked to many entities in B, and vice versa.

   Example: A student can take many courses, and a course can have many students.

### Relationship Participation:
- Mandatory Participation: Every entity must be involved in the relationship.

- Optional Participation: Not all entities are required to participate in the relationship.

### Types of Relationships:
1. Unary Relationship (Recursive):

   A relationship between entities in the same entity set.

   Example: An employee manages other employees.

2. Ternary Relationship:

   A relationship between three entities.

   Example: A project involves multiple employees and departments.

### Weak Entities:
    A weak entity doesn't have a unique key attribute. It relies on another entity for identification.

Example: An order item depends on an order to identify it.

### Attribute Inheritance:
    Lower-level entities inherit attributes from higher-level entities.

Example: A car inherits properties from a vehicle, like make and model.

### Constraints on Specialization/Generalization:
1. Membership Constraints:

   Defines how entities belong to subclasses (e.g., tanker is a type of ship).

2. Disjoint Constraints:

   Disjoint: An entity can belong to only one subclass (e.g., postgraduate or undergraduate, but not both).

   Overlapping: An entity can belong to multiple subclasses (e.g., someone can be both staff and student).

3. Completeness Constraints:

   Total: Every entity in the superclass must belong to a subclass (e.g., all students are either postgraduate or undergraduate).

   Partial: Some entities may not belong to any subclass (e.g., some people are neither students nor staff).

### Aggregation:
    Aggregation is when we treat a relationship between entities as an entity itself.

This helps simplify complex diagrams by grouping relationships into a higher-level entity.

## Relational Model
The Relational Model is a framework for structuring data using tables (relations), where each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). The key components include:

Relation (Table): Represents an entity or a relationship between entities.

Tuple (Row): A single record in a relation.

Attribute (Column): A property of an entity.

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each tuple in a relation.

Foreign Key: A reference to the primary key in another relation to establish relationships.

##  The Importance of the Relational Model

The relational model provides several key benefits:

Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency through constraints like primary and foreign keys.

Flexibility: Allows for easy updates and modifications without affecting existing data structures.

Security: Provides granular access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information.

Scalability: Supports large-scale applications with structured data processing.

## Designing a Relational Schema

The process of designing a relational database schema involves:

Identifying Entities: Determine the real-world objects to be stored.

Determining Attributes: Define the properties of each entity.

Establishing Relationships: Define how entities are related.

Assigning Keys: Choose primary and foreign keys to enforce uniqueness and relationships.

Example Schema:

Student (StudentNo, Name, Address, Programme_ID)

Programme (Programme_ID, Programme_Name, Start_Year, Dept_ID)

Department (Dept_ID, Dept_Name, HOD)

## Translating ERD to Relational Schema

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) visually represent database structures before they are converted into a relational schema. The steps include:

Convert Entities to Tables

Each entity in the ERD becomes a table.

Handle Multivalued Attributes

Create separate tables for attributes with multiple values.

Convert Relationships

One-to-Many (1:N): The primary key of the "one" side is a foreign key on the "many" side.

Many-to-Many (M:N): Introduce a junction table with foreign keys from both related tables.

One-to-One (1:1): The primary key of one entity can act as a foreign key in another.

Example:

1:1 Relationship:

Student (StudentNo, Name) → Identity (StudentNo, National_ID)

1:N Relationship:

Programme (Programme_ID, Programme_Name) → Student (StudentNo, Programme_ID)

M:N Relationship:

Student_Course (StudentNo, CourseID) bridges Student and Course tables.

## Introduction to Relational Algebra

Relational Algebra is a set of operations used to query and manipulate relational databases. Key operations include:

Selection (σ): Filters rows based on conditions.

Example: σ StudentNo = "12345" (Student) → Retrieves details of Student 12345.

Projection (π): Retrieves specific columns.

Example: π Name, Address (Student) → Retrieves only Name and Address.

Union (∪): Combines results from two relations.

Example: Student1 ∪ Student2

Intersection (∩): Retrieves common records between two relations.

Example: Student1 ∩ Student2

Difference (-): Finds records in one relation but not in another.

Example: Student1 - Student2

Join (⋈): Combines two relations based on a common attribute.

Example: Student ⋈ Programme_ID=Programme_ID Programme


## Advanced Topics in Relational Databases

1. Normalization

   Normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The common normal forms include:

   1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures that all columns contain atomic values.

   2NF (Second Normal Form): Removes partial dependencies.

   3NF (Third Normal Form): Eliminates transitive dependencies.

2. Indexes in Databases

   Indexes improve the efficiency of queries by allowing faster lookups. Common types include:

   Primary Index: Automatically created on the primary key.

   Secondary Index: Created on frequently queried columns.

   Clustered Index: Determines the physical order of data storage.

3. Transactions and ACID Properties

   A transaction is a sequence of database operations that must be executed as a single unit. The ACID properties ensure reliability:

   Atomicity: Transactions are all-or-nothing.

   Consistency: Ensures database integrity before and after transactions.

   Isolation: Transactions are independent of each other.

   Durability: Completed transactions persist even after system failures.

4. SQL vs NoSQL Databases

   Relational databases (SQL-based) are structured and enforce relationships through foreign keys, while NoSQL databases provide more flexibility for unstructured or semi-structured data.

   Examples:

   SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
  
   NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase.
