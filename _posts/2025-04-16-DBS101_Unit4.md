##  Lesson 9: Joins, Views, and Data Types
   The lesson focused on how to combine, organize, and structure data effectively.

### Joins - Connecting Data

   - Natural Join: Matches columns with the same name automatically.

   - Inner Join: Returns only matching rows (default join type).

   -  Outer Joins:

      - Left Join: Keeps all rows from the left table, plus matches from the right.

      - Right Join: Keeps all rows from the right table, plus matches from the left.

      - Full Outer Join: Keeps all rows from both tables, filling gaps with NULLs.

### Views – Virtual Tables for Security & Simplicity
   - Views act as saved queries, simplifying complex operations.

   -  Unlike real tables, they don’t store data (unless materialized).

   -  Useful for restricting access—only show users what they need.


### Data Types – Choosing the Right Format
   - Date/Time Types: Different precision levels (datetime2 vs. smalldatetime).

   - Large Objects: Storing files like images (BLOB) or long text (CLOB).

   - Custom Types: Defining your own data formats for consistency.


## Lesson 10: Indexes, Security, and SQL in Apps
### Indexes – Speeding Up Searches
- Indexes help find data faster but slow down inserts/updates.

- Unique indexes enforce no duplicates in a column.

### Authorization – Controlling Access
- Users and roles can be granted specific permissions (read, write, delete).

- The PUBLIC keyword applies permissions to all users.

- Privileges can be revoked if access needs to be removed.

### Connecting SQL to Applications
- Dynamic SQL: Queries built at runtime (e.g., JDBC for Java).

- Embedded SQL: SQL statements written directly in code (preprocessed).

- APIs like ODBC allow programs to interact with databases.

## Lesson 11: Functions, Procedures & Triggers
### Functions vs. Procedures

| Functions            | Procedures                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Return a single value | Can return multiple values or nothing |
| Used in queries      | Called explicitly              |
| For calculations     | For executing tasks            |

### Triggers – Automatic Actions
- Triggers run automatically when data changes (insert, update, delete).

- Useful for enforcing rules that constraints can’t handle.

- Caution: Can cause unexpected loops if not designed carefully.


## Lesson 12: Recursive Queries
### Recursive CTEs – Handling Hierarchies
- Used for parent-child relationships (e.g., org charts, file systems).

- Must have a base case and a recursive part.

- Restrictions:

   - Cannot use aggregation on recursive views.

   - Must avoid operations that break monotonicity.




## Conclusion
Looking back on these lessons, I realize how much my understanding of databases has grown. At first, SQL seemed like just a way to retrieve data, but now I see it as a powerful tool for organizing, securing, and automating information.
Joins taught me how to connect data meaningfully—whether matching exact records or preserving all entries with outer joins. Views became my go-to for simplifying complex queries and controlling access. I now appreciate how indexes balance speed and efficiency, even if they require careful use.

Security was a big shift in my thinking. Before, I assumed databases were just about storing data, but authorization showed me how critical permissions are in real-world applications. Defining roles and restricting access made me see databases as not just storage, but secure systems.

The most exciting part was learning about functions, procedures, and triggers. Automating tasks with triggers felt like unlocking a new level of efficiency—though I now know they must be used wisely to avoid chaos. Recursive queries were challenging but rewarding, especially for hierarchical data like organizational structures.

Overall, this journey transformed how I approach databases. They’re not just static collections of data but dynamic systems that can enforce rules, optimize performance, and adapt to real-world needs. I’m excited to apply these concepts in future projects—with a lot more confidence and creativity!
