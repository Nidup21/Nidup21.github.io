## Lesson 18: Database Transactions and ACID Properties
### 1. Transaction Definition
- A transaction is a collection of operations forming a single logical unit of work, bounded by BEGIN TRANSACTION and END TRANSACTION.
- Example: A funds transfer from account A to B, consisting of read/write operations.

### 2. ACID Properties (Core Transaction Characteristics)
| Property     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Atomicity    | All operations complete, or none do. If a transfer fails, all changes are rolled back. |
| Consistency  | The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction. E.g., total balance is preserved in a transfer. |
| Isolation    | Transactions execute as if serial. Prevents issues like dirty reads from concurrent operations. |
| Durability   | Committed changes persist even after system failures, stored in stable storage. |

### 3. Transaction Models and Storage
- Simple Transaction Example:
BEGIN; UPDATE A SET balance -= 50; UPDATE B SET balance += 50; COMMIT;

- Storage Types:
  - Volatile (e.g., memory): Fast, lost on crash.
  - Non-volatile (e.g., disk): Persistent, slower.
  - Stable: Multiple copies to ensure data survival (e.g., RAID).
- Transaction States: Active → Partially Committed → Failed → Aborted/Committed.

### 4. Isolation and Scheduling
- Scheduling Types:
  - Serial: Transactions execute one after another, ensuring consistency.
  - Non-serial: Operations interleave, risking inconsistency.
  - Serializable Schedule: A non-serial schedule that produces the same result as a serial one, enforced by concurrency control (e.g., locking).

## Lesson 19: Concurrency Control and Locking

### 1. Lock Basics
- Purpose: Prevent conflicts in concurrent transactions, enforce isolation.

- Lock Modes:
  - Shared (S): Allows reading by multiple transactions, no writing.
  - Exclusive (X): Allows reading and writing, blocks other transactions.

- Compatibility Matrix:

   | Lock Type | S Lock | X Lock |
   |-----------|--------|--------|
   | S Lock    | Yes    | No     |
   | X Lock    | No     | No     |

### 2. Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
- Growing Phase: Acquire locks, no releases.

- Shrinking Phase: Release locks, no new acquisitions.

- Goal: Ensure serializable schedules, but may cause deadlocks.

### 3. Deadlock Handling
- Deadlock: Circular waiting (e.g., T1 waits for T2, T2 waits for T1).

- Solutions:
  - Detection: Use a waits-for graph to find cycles, roll back a "victim" transaction.

  - Prevention: Assign timestamps (older transactions have priority) to avoid cycles.

### 4. Lock Granularity and Intention Locks

- Granularity: Scope of locks (attribute → tuple → page → table). Coarser granularity reduces overhead but lowers concurrency.

- Intention Locks:
  - IS (Intention Shared): Child nodes will take S locks.

  - IX (Intention Exclusive): Child nodes will take X 
  locks.

  - Purpose: Efficiently check lock compatibility without scanning all child nodes.

### 5. Concurrency Control Strategies
- Pessimistic: Prevent conflicts upfront (e.g., 2PL, timestamp ordering).

- Optimistic: Allow transactions to proceed, check for conflicts before commit; roll back if conflicts exist.

## Lesson 20: Database Recovery Mechanisms

### 1. Importance of Recovery
- Critical for handling system crashes, transaction failures, hardware errors, etc., to maintain data consistency and atomicity.

### 2. Log Records
- Purpose: Record all database modifications for undo/redo operations.
Format: <Transaction ID, Data Item, Old Value, New Value>, with records for START, COMMIT, and ABORT.
WAL (Write-Ahead Logging): Logs are written to stable storage before data modifications to ensure atomicity/durability.

### 3. Recovery Operations
- Undo: Roll back uncommitted transactions by restoring old values from logs.

- Redo: Apply committed transactions' new values from logs to ensure durability.

- Crash Recovery Steps:
  -  Identify transactions that need undo (no COMMIT) or redo (have COMMIT).

  - Use logs to restore the database to a consistent state.

### 4. Checkpoints and Fuzzy Checkpoints
- Checkpoints: Periodically write log records and modified data to disk, truncate old logs, and record active transactions. Reduces recovery time by limiting log scanning.

- Fuzzy Checkpoints: Allow transactions to continue during checkpointing, improving system availability with minimal overhead.

### 5. High Availability and Recovery Algorithms
- Remote Backup: Maintain a replica at a remote site, updated via log shipping, to take over if the primary fails.

- ARIES Algorithm: A three-pass recovery method (Analysis, Redo, Undo) used in systems like DB2, ensuring consistency after crashes.

### 6. Main-Memory Database Recovery
- Optimizations: Rebuild indices post-recovery, reduce logging overhead, and parallelize recovery across CPU cores for faster restart.

## Conclusion

In these lessons, I've learned that database transactions, which are logical units of work, must follow ACID properties—atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability—to work reliably. Storage types like volatile and non-volatile media affect how transactions are implemented. Concurrency control using shared/exclusive locks and two-phase locking stops conflicts in concurrent operations, while deadlock detection/prevention handles circular waiting, and lock granularity balances overhead with parallelism. Recovery mechanisms rely on log records and the WAL protocol to undo or redo operations, keeping the database consistent after failures. Checkpoints and ARIES speed up recovery, and remote backups ensure high availability—all of which are key to building robust database systems.
